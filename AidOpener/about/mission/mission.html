	            <br />
	            <p>International aid is credited with some great achievements but is tainted by histories of fiasco which emerge from time to time: word of money wasted, corruption fed, and side-effects rampant.</p>
	            <p>Full details of aid activities and their results have a tendency to stay within the industry. Aid depends on public money and the idea of public interest. But its implementation is usually difficult, and its effects are always mixed: often potentially embarrassing and controversial. So industry insiders have little incentive to cut back the thickets of expert jargon, commercial confidentiality and administrative caution that keep project realities muffled from the public sphere.</p>
	            <p>New (or not-so-new) communications technology should mean it is easier to share and openly debate reports on aid projects. But this has been slow to happen. </p>
	            <p>The mission of AidOpener is to help make it happen, and happen constructively. AO provides tools for activists, practitioners, students, journalists and members of the wider public to get, share, analyze, discuss and act on information about aid activities. AidOpener will support the further development of standards of openness and quality in aid.</p>
