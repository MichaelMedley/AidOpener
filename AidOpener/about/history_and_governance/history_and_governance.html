					<h2 style="text-align:center;font-weight:900;">AidOpener’s history and governance</h2>
					<br>
					<p>AidOpener is not yet an organization: it is still only a starter concept and website. The website is owned and run by an individual, Michael Medley. When trying to research the impact of aid in South Sudan, Michael began writing a computer program in mid-2014 for more convenient access to data from the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). That program has became the first version of the IATI Aid Activity Tabulator. The website – and the concept of AidOpener – has begun being built around that. The site was first uploaded in April 2015.</p>
					<p>AidOpener so far has no material resources other than those of Michael as a volunteer activist. The idea is now to develop it into a more formal project, and to give it strength and stability by setting it within a foundation or other regulated organization. AidOpener will report all its funding and project activities on this website.</p>
					<p>Michael Medley’s work has centered largely on Sudan and South Sudan, where he has been a teacher, aid-worker, researcher and consultant, beginning in 1987. He gained a PhD from Bristol University (UK), studying the politics of humanitarian aid. He now lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and is the regular guest co-ordinator of the course on Development Project Management for the MA in International Development Studies at Chulalongkorn University.</p>
